# Kaggle-Competition-Titanic-Machine-Learning

In this competition it was asked to build a predictive model that answers the question: "what sorts of people were more likely to survive?‚Äù using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

A number of feature engineering techniques are executed in order to achieve the highest possible prediction of people that survived the crash. Then, binary classification using a Decision Tree was applied.
